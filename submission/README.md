# Radeon Voice Skill Foundry - Track 2 Submission

**Speak the SOP. Prove the Skill.**

Radeon Voice Skill Foundry turns a private spoken SOP and an aligned workflow
demonstration into a verified, reusable Agent Skill before the Agent is allowed
to perform risky actions.

## Why It Matters

Action traces capture what an expert did. Voice captures why, when, exceptions,
privacy boundaries, and what must never happen.

The system compiles both signals into:

- typed SOP constraints
- least-privilege capability policy
- positive and adversarial fixtures
- deterministic verification
- governance receipts
- a hash-bound proof bundle
- a versioned Verified Skill that can be reused without replanning
