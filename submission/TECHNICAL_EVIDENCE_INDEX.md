## System Capability Map

| Capability | Implementation | Evidence | Demo timestamp | Boundary |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Voice-seeded workflow capture | Voice records conditions, exceptions, and prohibited side effects that are absent from a UI trace | Project Specification sections 1-3; generated `SKILL.md`, policy, fixtures, and proof ZIP | Product Demo 00:00-00:29 | Synthetic SOP audio is disclosed as a reproducible fixture |
| Cross-modal policy induction | Private speech supplies hidden intent, demonstrated actions supply real tool/state evidence, and local retrieval supplies authority; the resulting policy is typed and verified | `CROSS_MODAL_POLICY_INDUCTION.png`; Project Specification section 3; proof `action_contract.json` and `rag_evidence.json` | Product Demo 00:00-02:48 | The illustrated ASR-negation conflict is explanatory; measured Omni taxonomy rejection is separately recorded |
| Local knowledge retrieval | Deterministic token-overlap retrieval over local policy and SOP documents | Project Specification sections 4-5; public Memory module; proof ZIP | Product Demo 00:29-04:15 | Retrieval is token-overlap search, not embedding or vector search |
| Tool invocation and planning | Typed tools and six server-accepted actions compile into a multi-step procedure, constraints, permissions, and fixtures | Public Voice and Proof modules; generated policy; proof ZIP | Product Demo 00:29-02:48 | The workspace isolates external side effects |
| Multi-turn refinement | A natural-language correction creates revision 2, binds `parentRunId`, and regenerates constraints and fixtures without overwriting the prior run; another correction creates revision 3 and reopens verification | 35.5-second Director Cut with locally generated VoxCPM2 narration; raw 32-second product capture; screenshot; brief; lineage; JSON; child proof ZIP | Director Cut `00:00-00:35.5` | The Director Cut is independent of the 4:49 Product Demo; the raw capture remains the primary product evidence |
| Verification and procedural memory | Deterministic replay, five fail-closed probes, typed harness/verifier contracts, bounded verifier repair, versioned memory, promotion, ledger export, and exact reuse | Public Proof and Memory modules; submission `68/68` suite; agent harness repair proof; verified workflow proof and ledger | Product Demo 02:48-04:15; repair evidence JSON | Reuse applies only to an identical promoted skill; non-policy failures remain manual-only |
| Core inference on Radeon | Qwen3-ASR-0.6B and Qwen3-4B-Instruct-2507 run on W7900-class `gfx1100` with ROCm 7.2.1 | Live `/api/health`; Radeon audio proof; verified workflow proof ZIP | Product Demo 00:29-01:53 | Real model waiting time is preserved |
| Unedited W7900 execution | One continuous public run shows health, ASR, primary-model compile, 7/7 verification, and the full proof hash | 48.96-second raw WebM/MP4; `W7900_LIVE_EVIDENCE_SUMMARY.json` | Unedited capture 00:00-00:48.96 | MP4 is a full-length codec transcode only |
| Public stable-URL operation | External launchd monitor validates HTTP 200 and model/ASR dependency health | `PUBLIC_HEALTH_SUMMARY.json`; `PUBLIC_HEALTH_HISTORY.jsonl` | N/A | 187.6-minute captured interval, 39/39 healthy |
| Independent cloud health checks | GitHub Actions validates Radeon mode plus model and ASR dependencies outside the W7900 and local Mac process trees | `GITHUB_SCHEDULED_HEALTH_SUMMARY.json`; workflow run links | N/A | 29/29 scheduled checks over 50.75 observed hours; schedule is best-effort and observed executions are reported exactly |
| Allocation continuity | Radeon Cloud Profile still showed 5 credits available and 0 consumed after 54.76 hours | `LIVE_RADEON_RECOVERY_EVIDENCE.json` | N/A | Platform allocation policy remains organizer-controlled |
| Targeted inference optimization | Same-hardware vLLM serving A/B, GPU package-energy integration, native ASR batching, and compact structured output | Radeon experiment summary; `evidence/BOARD_ENERGY_SUMMARY.json`; source benchmark JSON in the project repository | Performance Demo 03:38-04:13 | Board energy excludes CPU, RAM, cooling, and PUE; vLLM C8 is a concurrent serving result |
| Audio-native policy cross-check | Qwen2.5-Omni-3B listens to the original SOP audio and independently proposes typed policy rules without using the ASR transcript | `AUDIO_NATIVE_POLICY_CRITIC_SUMMARY.json`; reproducible experiment scripts | N/A | Research-only critic under the Qwen Research License; it never grants permissions or replaces the production pipeline |

| Local memory | Versioned Verified Skill Registry and exact reuse | Performance Demo 03:08-03:36 |

and rollback actions.

## Demo Artifact Boundaries

- `RADEON_VOICE_SKILL_FOUNDRY_DEMO.mp4` is the primary 4:49 contest video. It
  records the public product path, including real W7900 inference, promotion,
  ledger export, and exact reuse. It ends with a terminology card that states
  the package and integrity boundaries.
- `RADEON_VOICE_SKILL_FOUNDRY_PERFORMANCE_DEMO.mp4` is supplementary performance
  narration for the same public Radeon path. Its spoken `35/35` count belongs
  to the pinned recording revision.
- `CONTINUOUS_OPERATION_DEMO.mp4` uses deterministic ASR/compiler fixtures
  while performing real process restarts and durable recovery. It documents
  compatibility, invalidation, and parent-child proof lineage rather than GPU
  performance.
- `W7900_LIVE_EVIDENCE_UNEDITED.mp4` and its WebM source are supplementary,
  silent runtime evidence; the external SRT labels each recorded stage.

## Audio-Native Policy Critic Experiment

An isolated W7900 experiment evaluated `Qwen/Qwen2.5-Omni-3B` as an
audio-native policy critic. The model consumed the original 20.39-second
Chinese SOP WAV directly, with no ASR transcript supplied.

- BF16, SDPA, Talker disabled
- model revision `f75b40e3da2003cdd6e1829b1f420ca70797c34e`
- median strict-prompt inference: `9.171 seconds`
- maximum strict-prompt allocated VRAM: `9.108 GiB`
- strict taxonomy admission: `3/3`
- clean, pink-noise, and alert-tone variants preserved all four required
  safety kinds

The unconstrained prompt recovered all four safety semantics but mislabeled
`redact` and `requires_confirmation` as ordinary requirements. The admission
gate rejected that result. Explicit taxonomy guidance repaired the candidate,
but the production decision remains fail-closed: Qwen3-ASR plus Qwen3-4B stays
authoritative, and the Omni model is only an independent research critic.

## Evidence Boundaries

- Exact reuse is an application fast path for an identical promoted skill. It
  is excluded from fresh-inference GPU performance claims.
- Proof archives preserve their original internal `projectName`, `SKILL.md`
  name, and policy semantic-version fields because those values identify the
  recorded run and participate in artifact verification. They are immutable
  evidence identifiers, not alternate submission deliverables.
- The Product Demo's recorded `GAIA-compatible` phrase refers only to portable
  Agent Skill Markdown. No external GAIA conformance or certification is
  claimed.
- Voice Evidence values are internal deterministic quality-gate results, not
  external speech-recognition accuracy measurements.
- Ledger hashes are not digital signatures and are not anchored to an external
  immutable service.
- Quark INT8 improved memory capacity but was slower and failed the required
  policy-semantic gate. Production remains FP16.

## Integrity Anchors

`SHA256SUMS.txt` contains the SHA-256 digest for every finalized artifact in
the submission package except the checksum manifest itself. It is regenerated
after all documents, media, proofs, and evidence files are finalized.
